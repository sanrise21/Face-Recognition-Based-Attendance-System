# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

Real Time face recognition can be very helpful in areas where an application requires authentication for its access. There are many upcoming and existing applications which require authentication on a daily basis for example gmail etc. therefore providing real time authentication using face gives an easy and secure way to access such applications. This can also be helpful in marking attendance in virtual meetings, virtual classes etc. In this project I have built a face recognition system which marks the attendance of an attende using face as their identity .We have used python face-recognition library for this project which gives us a quick and easy way to compare and recognise the faces.  

To run project:   

STEP1: Create folder containing photos of employees/students etc whose biometric data is to be captured later for attendance.  
STEP2:Store their name,id,folder location of their biometric sample(created above) in a csv file.  
STEP3: Make sure you have specified correct paths in the code.That's it! Run code!   

The ouput will be a image sof the person along with its name stamp and details will be stored in a txt file showing name,id and time recorded.
